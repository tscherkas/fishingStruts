		<h2>Fishings firm</h2>
		<p>Fishing is the activity of trying to catch fish. Fishing
			sometimes takes place in the wild. Techniques for catching fish
			include hand gathering, spearing, netting, angling and trapping.</p>
		<p>The term fishing may be applied to catching other aquatic
			animals such as molluscs, cephalopods, crustaceans, and echinoderms.
			The term is not normally applied to catching farmed fish, or to
			aquatic mammals, such as whales, where the term whaling is more
			appropriate.</p>
		<p>According to FAO statistics, the total number of commercial
			fishermen and fish farmers is estimated to be 38 million. Fisheries
			and aquaculture provide direct and indirect employment to over 500
			million people in developing countries. In 2005, the worldwide per
			capita consumption of fish captured from wild fisheries was 14.4
			kilograms, with an additional 7.4 kilograms harvested from fish
			farms. In addition to providing food, modern fishing is also a
			recreational pastime.</p>
